      <p><b>Merge sort</b> is a sorting algorithm that sorts data items into ascending or descending order, which comes under the category of comparison-based sorting. Here we apply the divide-and-conquer strategy to sort a given sequence of data items, which can be described as follows:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Recursively split the sequence into two halves (i.e. subsequences) until the subsequence contains only a single data item (i.e. singleton subsequence)</li>
        <li>Now, recursively merge these subsequences back together preserving their required order (i.e. ascending or descending order)</li>
      </ul>
