      <h4>Why do people like to get into product based companies?</h4>
      <h5>Two Things (Passion and Money)</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>(Passion)</b> The people who really loves computer science likes to solve the real world problems using their algorithmic skills. Big product based companies will provide such problems and environment where you can enhance your skills. Service based company use mostly tools and scope for development is less where no need to stretch that much which will rust your brain.
        </li>
        <li class="margin-top-10px">
          <b>(Money)</b> The pay in product based company is very good which can change your life style. Service based company will have worst pay and work hikes. Only good thing is if you get onsite for long term then you will can see the change in your life style otherwise you need to compromise for so many things in Metropolitan Cities.</b>

      </ul>

      <h4>How to get placed into good Product based companies?</h4>
      <p>If you want to place into good product based company follow the below:</p>
      <h5>Getting an interview Call:</h5>
      <ul>
        <li><i class="fa fa-check margin-right-10px"></i>
          Most of the product based companies will recruit the students from IITs, NITs and from good private engineering colleges.
        </li>
        <li class="margin-top-10px"><i class="fa fa-check margin-right-10px"></i>
          If you are from normal engineering college or out of college then try referrals.(So better maintain good contacts with software developers to get the referrals)
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h5>Preparation:</h5>
      <p>In order to perform well in the interview your preparation should involve the following:</p>
      <b>Algorithmic Skill:</b>
      <ul>
        <li>
          For a good software developer Logical and problem solving skills are very important due to this Algorithms and data structures playing a very key role in clearing the technical interview. So try to be confident in this subject. Lots of videos are available over internet for Design and Analysis of Algorithms. Please be strong in this area.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <b>Coding Skill:</b>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Coding is another key skill to clear the interview. Coding is just a tool (Programming language) to implement your solution (Algorithm) for the problem. Try to be expert in any one of the programming language (Either C or java..Etc). Technical interview involves the coding test by giving some problems to you and solve them using your favorite language.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <blockquote>Best Book : (Cracking the Coding Interview: 150 Programming Questions and Solutions: Gayle Laakmann)</blockquote>

          After learning above two main critical skills (Algorithms and Coding) now this is the time to apply those skills. <br/>
          Participate in code challenges like HackerRank,CodeChef,TopCoder.. etc.
        </li>
        <li>
          Work on open source projects, or try developing a complete software application from scratch which will make your lean lot of skills.
        </li>
      </ul>
